* A factory pattern or Factory method patterns says that just "define an interface or abstract class for creating an
  object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate". In other words, subclasses are responsible to create
  the instance of the class. It is also known as Virtual Constructor.

* Advantage
    + Factory method pattern allows the sub classes to choose the type of objects to create.
    + It promoted loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application specific classes into the code. It means
      that the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class, so that it will work with any
      classes that implement that interface or that extends that abstract class.

* Usage
